# Django React Auth - Render Deployment Guide

This application is configured for easy deployment on Render.com.

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare your repository
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Render

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com) and sign up/log in
2. Click "New +" and select "Blueprint"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and set up:
   - A PostgreSQL database
   - A web service with build and start commands
   - Environment variables

### 3. Set Environment Variables

In your Render dashboard, add these environment variables:

**Required:**
- `DJANGO_ENVIRONMENT`: `production`
- `DEBUG`: `False`
- `SECRET_KEY`: (auto-generated by Render)
- `DATABASE_URL`: (auto-configured by Render)

**Optional (for your app features):**
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Your Twilio account SID
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Twilio auth token
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

### 4. Deploy

Once you've connected your repo and set the environment variables:
1. Click "Apply" to start the deployment
2. Render will run the build script and start your application
3. Your app will be available at the provided URL
